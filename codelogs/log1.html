	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

            <strong>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</strong>
            <p>Non semantic tags like <i>div</i> and <i>span</i> don’t say what the content is. They’re just there to group things or help with layout.
            Semantic tags like <i>header</i>, <i>img</i>, <i>table</i>, <i>article</i> and <i>footer</i> actually describe what that part of the page is. They give meaning, 
            so both people and tools can understand the structure better.</p>
            </li>

            <strong>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</strong>
            <p>Semantic tags help screen readers understand what each part of the page is. That makes it easier for people who use assistive tech to navigate the content.  
            They also make the code easier to read and maintain, because the tags already show what the content is without needing comments or extra class names.  
            On top of that, search engines can read the page better and understand the structure, which helps with Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).</p>
