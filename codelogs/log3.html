                <strong>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</strong>
                <p>A CSS media query basically checks if certain conditions about the screen or device are true, and
                    then applies specific styles if they are. They're super useful because they let you make your
                    website responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes or environments, like phones,
                    tablets, desktops, or even when someone tries to print a page. It helps the design stay readable and
                    functional no matter where it's viewed.

                <strong>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" —
                    and what do they do? Pick any 4 to explain.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        aspect-ratio:
                        This checks the ratio between the width and height of the viewport. It’s useful if you want your
                        layout or elements to change depending on whether the screen is wide or tall in shape, like on
                        phones vs. ultrawide monitors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        display-mode:
                        Often used for web apps. It lets you detect if your page is being viewed as a standalone app
                        (like when saved to a phone’s home screen) or just in a regular browser tab. You can adjust
                        layouts to behave more like native apps when needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        resolution:
                        This one checks the pixel density of the screen, or how sharp or high-quality the display
                        is. It's useful if you want to load higher resolution images or adjust font sizes for devices
                        like
                        Retina displays.
                    <li>
                        pointer:
                        Tells you what kind of pointer device is being used. A fine pointer means a mouse (precise),
                        while coarse means something like a finger on a touchscreen. This helps when deciding how big
                        clickable elements should be.
