                <strong>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</strong>
                <p>A CSS media query basically checks if certain conditions about the screen or device are true, and
                    then applies specific styles if they are. They're super useful because they let you make your
                    website responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes or environments, like phones,
                    tablets, desktops, or even when someone tries to print a page. It helps the design stay readable and
                    functional no matter where it's viewed.
